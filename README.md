# Text Classification with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn

This project focuses on text classification using a neural network built with PyTorch. It leverages `CountVectorizer` from `scikit-learn` for text preprocessing and includes evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure the modelâ€™s performance.
Contains [AppFlaskPyTorch](AppFlaskPyTorch) - server with Flask and PyTorch on docker, click for read more information.



## How to use
1. Put labeled data **excel** file in `./data/train_data` for train model   
Column with text - named - 'text'
Column with label - named - 'label'  

2. Run train model
 ```shell
   python train.py
   ```
3. Model and parameters save in `./saved/model/`

4. Put your data witch you want to classificate in `./data/for_prediction_data`
5. ```python run_predict_data.py```
6. Classificated data will be saved in `./data/output_data` with `label`
